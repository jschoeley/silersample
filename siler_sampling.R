#' The Siler Distribution is characterized by a hazard of the form
#' $h(x) = a_1\exp(-b_1x) + a_2 + a_3\exp(b_3x)$,
#' i.e. a competing risks model with 3 independent "causes" of death.
#' Thus, one can sample survival times from the model via
#' $\min(X_1, X_2, X_3)$, where $X_i$ are the latent survival times sampled
#' for each of the three causes of death. The lowest of those times is
#' the time of death.
#' The hazard implies that survival times are distributed as negative
#' Gompertz for cause 1, as exponential for cause 2, and as Gompertz for
#' cause 3. Survival times from these distributions can readily be
#' using `base` R and the `flexsurv` package.
